# Image-Processing-using-SIFT-Algorithm

The complete Code was written in Matlab. We have taken a source talking about Image forensics from IEEE paper and implemented a SIFT (Space Invariant Fourier Transform) Algorithm to detect if the image has been forged/Morphed but comparing the image we have with the original image.

We also used some photoshop tools to make changes to the images and then extracted keypoints from both the image files and then compared to to verify if the image was forged or not.

The results were also attached to this repo for better understanding
